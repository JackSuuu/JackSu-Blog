It is maybe a bit cliche that saying myself as a programmer has been a not good title for me for a long time, I hate the stereotype related to it, thick glasses, grid t-shirts, it feels like a prison that restricts me and let my thoughts to fly around the universe.

My initial interaction with computer science is at my grade 10 summer, that was a day that I finished all important exam, struggle about the uncertain things will happen in the future, I open the first python tutorial ever in my life in a Chemistry Lab.
